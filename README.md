# GreenLuma UI
GreenLuma is an unofficial tool designed to modify the Steam client. It enables users to access games and features they have not officially purchased, such as by forging licenses or activating other users’ game libraries.

**Typically, GreenLuma is used to bypass the following restrictions:**
1) Bypassing Steam Family Sharing’s simultaneous access limits. The tool can mask your activity on Steam, allowing all family members with GreenLuma installed and configured to play the same copy of a game simultaneously.
2) Free access to DLC content. Developers often include DLC files with the base game but do not implement additional checks for ownership of bonus content. With proper setup, GreenLuma tricks Steam (and consequently the game) into believing you own the desired DLC.
3) Expanding the list of available games. Some games you or your Steam Family members own may not appear in the library without enabling a VPN. GreenLuma resolves this issue when configured correctly.

# How to find the SteamAppId for a specific application?
You can check an app’s ID by opening its store page in a browser and extracting it from the address bar OR by using the third-party site SteamDB (https://steamdb.info).
